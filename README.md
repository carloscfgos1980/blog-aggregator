Assignment
Create a README.md file in the root of your repo if you don't have one already. (You should be tracking your changes with Git.)
Explain to the user that they'll need Postgres and Go installed to run the program.
Explain to the user how to install the gator CLI using go install.
Explain to the user how to set up the config file and run the program. Tell them about a few of the commands they can run.
Push gator up to GitHub, then submit the link to your remote repo. Your link should look something like this: <https://github.com/github-username/repo-name>.
Remember: Go programs are statically compiled binaries. After running go build or go install, you should be able to run your code without needing the go toolchain.

go run . is just for development. gator is for production.
